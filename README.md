# Cornhole-Scoretracker
An easy GUI for recording Cornhole scores.

My friends were considering starting a cornhole league. i decided to try to create a basic scoretracking GUI for them to be able keep track of scores in a database in order to give monthly and season awards. It was never used so I never personalized it or packaged it for them to use.

It was fun learning to use tkinter though.
